Description of ruby file: https://github.com/feministy/katyperry.io/blob/master/app/helpers/api_v1_helpers.rb
* what does a module do here? imports? helpers?
* four functions defined:
1. gets the first word
2. gets multiple words?
* what does the "Word." method do?
* What does .pluck do?
-  I think this function takes an argument (maybe a string), puts the words in the string in a random order, and then stores one of the words.
3. gets one sentence?
* why does it set excuse to nil immediately rather than taking in just a variable?
* wait does it just set excuse to nil everytime the function is called?
* Then in the function gets the first sentence with a nil excuse?
4. Gets multiple sentences (similar to the second function)
* Performs logic based off of the boolean value of the excuse variable
* similar to the second function, it takes two arguments (one variable, and one variable that is nil), puts the sentences in a random order and then stores the sentence it found?
